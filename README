#Portfolio with react

Now that I'm learning and improving my skills with React and React Router, I take the opportunity to create my portfolio to 
apply some aspects I've learned. As I mentioned, this app is mainly made with React in conjunction with Vite. For the 
styling of the website I wanted to experiment with other technologies to deliver a better experience, that's why I used 
SASS.
I wanted to apply some animations, therefore for this project I used Animate.css which I used in another project already,
and GSAP, a new technology in my repertoire.

###Stack used
- HTML/CSS
- SASS
